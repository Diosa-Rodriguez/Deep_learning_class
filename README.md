# Deep Learning Practical Work 02 - Model Selection

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for **Practical Work 02** of the **MSE FTP Deep Learning** course. The main focus of this assignment is on **model selection**, specifically:

- Implementing and testing the **Cross-Entropy (CE) cost function**.
- Implementing **k-fold cross-validation** for hyperparameter tuning.

## Repository Contents

- **`DL-PW-02.pdf`**: The assignment instructions detailing the objectives, tasks, and submission requirements.
- **`k-fold_cross-validation_stud.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of gradient descent learning for a generalized perceptron with CE cost, along with k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
